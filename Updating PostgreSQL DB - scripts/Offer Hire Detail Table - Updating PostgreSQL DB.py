###Step 1
#Connect to database, import Excel file

###Step 2
#Connect to a table in PostgreSQL (without creating it once again)

###Step

###Step 3
#Finding new, unique offers
#Firstly, get new unique IDs of applications by comparing both tables
#Then, add it to the table

###Step 4
#Compare the offers that were made previously
#compare 2 dictionaries - if they are the same, then skip
#if not - upload a dictionary from the raw data
